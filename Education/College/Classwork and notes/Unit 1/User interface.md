# User Interface
- User interface allows the user to interact with a machine
- Users frequently evaluate a systems usability based on its UI
- An interface that is badly made can lead to users making mistakes
- Many applications are never used due to poor UI/UX designs.
# Types of UI
## GUI 
Operating systems designed using GUIs and general interfaces use images and icons. Common GUI interfaces;

| Common feature | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Windows | Allows you to have multiple windows with different information at the same time |
| Icons | Icons can show files or processes (task manager, the taskbar, windows explorer) |
| Menus | Most GUIs offer MBIs too. |
| Pointing | You can point at things using a mouse and click on them to select|
| Graphics | Graphic elements can be mixed with text on the same display |

| Pros | Cons |
| -- | -- |
| Simple and easy to learn | Consumers more drive space |
| Usable for beginners | Needs more RAM |
| Easy to move between tasks and applications | Can be slow for experienced users |
| Access to locations on the screen are al available instantly | |
## CLI
Operating systems designed around CLIs use just text, and require complex commands to be ran.
- Users enter text based commands
- These UIs use compilers to make it easy to process
- You can make simple interfaces with little typing
- Users can make errors in their commands
- Not suited for inexperienced users

| Pros | Cons |
| -- | -- |
| Uses less system resources | User needs prior knowledge
| Prefered by experiences users | Poor UX
| Faster and more efficient | You need to know the syntax to avoid syntax errors
## MBI
Both CLIs and GUIs use Menu Interfaces. These have many options that the system shows them, and you can pick from the option using text, or in a GUI clicking with a mouse

| Pros | Cons |
| -- | -- |
| Lists of commands are always in front of users | There can be many levels of menus and it may take a while |
| No need to type | Complex actions can not be perfromed
## AI
Addaptive interfaces supports to change the view;
- Multiple screens can be used and it adapts to the size
- Different elements will e moved around to allow for easier viewing
E.g. Web page
