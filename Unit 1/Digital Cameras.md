# Storing images
There are multiple ways of storing images in a camera; Each have their pros and cons

## Internally
Internal storage is like a memory card built into the camera, where photos and videos are stored.
### Pros:
- Convenience - You do not need any extra memory cards
- Reliability -  its less likely to get lost like external cards
- Faster access - You don't need to remove the storage card in order to access files
- Weather resistance - higher end cameras are water protected, and so it might be harder

### Cons:
- Limited capacity - There may be less storage space compared to an external SD card
- Non-expandable - You cant just add extra storage, you will need to delete or transfer files
- Risk of data loss - If the camera is damaged, there's a risk of losing any files inside of the storage.
- More expensive - cameras with higher internal storage can be more expensive.
## Externally
SD cards are small memory cards used in digital cameras to store data.

### Pros:
- Expandable storage - You can buy different sized SD cards for different uses.
- Easy to transfer - Easy to remove from the camera and put into a different device.
- Cost effective - You can pick any size SD card, and they are very cheap.
- Data security - Your data is separate from the camera, meaning if the camera is broken you can easily take the SD card out and transfer the data.
### Cons:
- Risk of loss/damage - SD cards are small and removable, therefore when you take them out/move them around they can be lost or damaged.
- Speed differences - Different SD cards can have different speeds, and higher-speed cards are often much more expensive.
- Compatibility issues - Not all cameras support all types of SD cards - there are different types of SD cards such as SDHC, SDXC and UHS
- Organisation issues - Multiple SD cards can cause issues with organising different photos/videos.

## SD Card standards

| SD Card Standard        | Definition                                                                                   | Example                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **SDSC (Standard Capacity)** | The original SD card standard with capacities up to 2 GB.                                  | A 2 GB SD card used in an older digital camera.    |
| **SDHC (High Capacity)**    | Offers higher capacity ranging from 4 GB to 32 GB.                                        | A 16 GB SDHC card used in a mid-range digital camera. |
| **SDXC (Extended Capacity)** | Provides vast storage capacity from 64 GB to 2 TB.                                      | A 128 GB SDXC card used in a 4K video recording camera. |
| **UHS-I (Ultra High-Speed Phase I)** | Offers faster data transfer speeds compared to standard SD cards. | A UHS-I U3 card used in a high-speed digital camera for 4K video. |
| **UHS-II (Ultra High-Speed Phase II)** | Provides even faster data transfer rates. | A UHS-II card with two rows of pins used in a high-end DSLR camera. |
| **UHS-III (Ultra High-Speed Phase III)** | The latest standard with ultra-high-speed data transfer. | A UHS-III card with advanced features for professional video cameras. |
| **microSD Cards** | Smaller versions suitable for mobile devices, action cameras, and drones. | A 64 GB microSD card used in a smartphone for storage expansion. |
| **microSDHC and microSDXC Cards** | Higher-capacity microSD cards following the same standards. | A 256 GB microSDXC card used in a drone for extended recording. |

# Zooms

## Optical Zoom

### About
Optical zoom is a type of zoom that zooms by changing the focal length. It provides "true" magnification without sacrificing image quality
### How it works
The cameras lens changes the focal length, bringing the subject closer or farther away.
### Pros
- Higher image quality
- Keeping pixel sizes (higher image quality)
- Can be used for anything
### Cons
- Better optical zoom is usually more expensive
- Better optical zoom lenses are usually bigger and heavier
## Digital Zoom

### About
Digital zoom enlarges images digitally without physically moving the lens.
### How it works
Digital zoom takes the image and "crops" it, making it smaller but more focused on one place. It therefore takes many pixels out and lowers image quality.
### Pros
- Compact size, doesn't need a big heavy lens
- More affordable as no need for a good lens
- More convenient, as you don't need to adjust a lens
### Cons
- Loss of image quality
- Less effective over long ranges
- Not good for professional use, as lower of image quality.

# Lenses
## Telephoto Lens

### About
A telephoto lens magnifies distant subjects, ideal for wildlife and sports photography.

### How it works
It uses optics to bring faraway objects closer without moving the camera, maintaining image quality.
### Pros
- Great for distant subjects
- Suitable for sports and wildlife
- Allows creative background effects

### Cons
- Can be bulky and heavy
- High-quality telephoto lenses are costly

## Macro Lens

### About
A macro lens captures extreme close-ups, perfect for intricate details.

### How it works
Optimized for short distances, it lets you get very close while keeping sharpness.

### Pros
- Ideal for tiny details
- Enables artistic close-ups
- Excellent image quality up close

### Cons
- Limited to extreme close-ups
- Requires stable focusing

## Wide-Angle Lens

### About
A wide-angle lens captures broad scenes, great for landscapes and creative shots.

### How it works
With a short focal length, it expands the field of view, adding depth.

### Pros
- Perfect for landscapes
- Great for interior and creative shots
- Adds drama to images

### Cons
- Can distort up close
- Not ideal for portraits

## Zoom Lens

### About
A zoom lens offers variable focal lengths, convenient for various photography styles.

### How it works
Using multiple lens elements, it switches between wide-angle and telephoto settings.

### Pros
- Can be used for different distances
- Convenient for everyday photography
- No for multiple lenses

### Cons
- Can be larger and heavier
- Slightly lower image quality
