# Storing images
There are multiple ways of storing images in a camera; Each have their pros and cons

## Internally
Internal storage is like a memory card built into the camera, where photos and videos are stored.
### Pros:
- Convenience - You do not need any extra memory cards
- Reliability -  its less likely to get lost like external cards
- Faster access - You don't need to remove the storage card in order to access files
- Weather resistance - higher end cameras are water protected, and so it might be harder

### Cons:
- Limited capacity - There may be less storage space compared to an external SD card
- Non-expandable - You cant just add extra storage, you will need to delete or transfer files
- Risk of data loss - If the camera is damaged, there's a risk of losing any files inside of the storage.
- More expensive - cameras with higher internal storage can be more expensive.

## Externally
SD cards are small memory cards used in digital cameras to store data.

### Pros:
- Expandable storage - You can buy different sized SD cards for different uses.
- Easy to transfer - Easy to remove from the camera and put into a different device.
- Cost effective - You can pick any size SD card, and they are very cheap.
- Data security - Your data is separate from the camera, meaning if the camera is broken you can easily take the SD card out and transfer the data.
### Cons:
- Risk of loss/damage - SD cards are small and removable, therefore when you take them out/move them around they can be lost or damaged.
- Speed differences - Different SD cards can have different speeds, and higher-speed cards are often much more expensive.
- Compatibility issues - Not all cameras support all types of SD cards - there are different types of SD cards such as SDHC, SDXC and UHS
- Organisation issues - Multiple SD cards can cause issues with organising different photos/videos.
