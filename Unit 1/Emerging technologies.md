# What are they?
Emerging technologies are usually a new technology, but can also be existing technology getting better.
# Different types of emerging technology
## Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence is currently booming into a big thing. Big products, such as ChatGPT and other generative AIs.
There's also other AIs that can monitor images and videos, to detect things, AIs that can read text and assistive AIs to help people with their daily lives.
AI algorithms ar used in streaming platforms to suggest content.
AI can also process data and make important decisions for companies and give information.
## IoT
IoT means Internet of Things. IoT devices, such as an Amazon Echo as a home device
An IoT device usually has sensors, processing ability, software or other technology to share data with other devices over the internet or other communications networks.
There are many different IoT devices;
### Commercial
Commercial IoT devices are used for business purposes to improve efficiency.
For example, an inventory management system to track stock.
### Industrial
Industrial devices are usually used to monitor machinery and processes.
For example, a device that detects malfunctions and alerts people.
### Consumer
Consumer IoT devices are designed for use in our daily lives.
For example, an amazon Alexa will help the user get information they need.
### Infrastructure
These types of IoT devices can be used to enhance public systems
For example, smart street lights that use the weather levels and traffic conditions to turn on and off.
## Machine Learning
Machine learning is a way of teaching machines how to do certain tasks - it is commonly used to train AI models, for example you can give a computer sample powerpoints to teach it how to make powerpoints.
## Automation
Automation Is the process of making something self-working, and to constantly do what needs doing by itself without needing human interaction.
## AR/VR
AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) are commonly used to play games, and are having new applications in rehabilitating prisoners within the current world.

# Personal Emerging technology
## Defenition
Personal emerging technology is emerging technology which is designed for personal/consumer use rather than for companies or industry use.
## Pros and cons

| Positive | Negative |
| -- | -- |
| Convenient to access devices | Can be expensive |
| Can help to perform tasks in a fast manner. | They require constant innovation to improve and upgrade |
| Good for people with disabilities to help them do tasks | Can be "too advanced" for people |

# Organisational Emerging technologies
## Definition
Organisational emerging technologies is designed to be used by businesses, to boost efficiency and create opportunities.
## Pros and cons

| Positive | Negative |
| -- | -- |
| Productivity, such as quicker payments by contactless payments | Can be expensive |
| Reduce of human error, for example sensors used to monitor temperatures | May require staff training |


# TODO: FINISH NOTES (SOFTWARE/CHOOSING IT SYSTEM)



















# task
Customers will likely have an interest in attactive products like coffee. this will incline people to buymore.
the existing system may need to be upgraded to enable this.
an rfid scheme can be used, dpeending on cost, to provide good tracking and data collection. it would work the same way as contactless card payments.

# task2

|filletype | benefit | drawback |
| -- | -- | -- |
| doc | They are similar to docx files | They are very old |
| docx | They have the most features | They need special software |
| rtf | Compatible with many things | There are not as much options |
# task 3
One factor that Benjamin would need to consider is the budget for the system, a low budget will require a console to be able to run the games however a high budget will allow for a desktop PC setup. 
Another factor that can decide what system to build is user experience - if Fraser has little experience using a desktop computer, it would be much smarter to get a console for this task but if he has experience with computers it would be beneficial to get a PC.

# task 4
pros and cons of proprietary vs FOSS

| | Advantage | Disadvantage |
| --| -- | -- |
| FOSS | Easy for users to edit and maintain the software | Exploits can be found and used to target users |
| Propietary | Dedicated team/company | Often expensive and you can be restriced |
