Another advantage of using an ethernet cable is that they can deliver higher speeds as it is electrical signals being sent over multiple wires at the same time. This allows you to get more traffic over one cable due to having 4 cables dedicated for transferring data at the same time.

One way that making the podcast downloadable will effect her choice of file type is if she is using audio only or having a video too.
If she's using audio only, then some of the options she may have would be;

- m4a - most commonly used by apple devices.
However, if you also need a video track, you have multiple other filetypes;

### A:
On one hand, selling goods online as well as in-store will be better for stock control, as you can have better systems for collecting both metrics and storing them better to collect more information. This will benefit the business as they will be able to have better, more advanced systems and collect more information.
However, development of these systems may be expensive to use and to upkeep. This will mean that she has to spend more time implementing the systems and keeping them up and running, as she will have to sync two different systems into one.
Overall, she would need to decide if it is worth the extra effort and cost to her to sell her products online as well as in-store, as it can have both the benefits and the drawbacks to migrate to a new system.
