# Assistive technology
## What is assistive technology
Assistive technology can help people with physical impairments or mental disabilities. These can be devices, equipment or software. They help people live more independently.

## Examples of assistive technology
- Screen readers
- Adaptive keyboards
- Alternative input devices
- Braille displays
- Screen magnifiers

### Adaptive keyboards
- Some keyboards have raised gaps between the keys rather than lower gaps, allowing people to put their hands on the keyboards before finding the key.
- High contrast keyboards help low vision users to differentiate between keys.
- Some keyboards have keyboard overlays, which is a plastic sheet with specific keys/functions marked out with specific colours, symbols, or pictures.

### Alternative input devices
#### Head pointers
Head pointers are objects mounted to the head, which allows the wearer to interact with a computer interface.
#### Single switch entry devices
A single switch entry device is often a large round colourful button, which preforms a specific action when hit.
#### Foot switches
Foot switches are similar to single switch devices, but use a foot pedal rather than a button.
#### Sip and puff devices
A sip and puff device allows a user to operate a computer by inhaling and exhaling into a pipe, which allows them to click or do something else depending on how they customise it
#### Eye tracking software
Eye tracking software follows the movement of the eyes, allowing the user to navigate web pages and type on a custom screen.

### Braille display

A braille display converts digital text on a screen into braille, and is usually connected to a computer/smartphone over Bluetooth/USB.

They often include a braille keyboard, and a QWERTY keyboard too.

# Manual vs automatic data processing

## Manual data processing
Manual data processing is when data is processed by human operators, using tools such as pen and paper, calculators, typewriters, etc
## Automatic data processing
Automatic data processing is when data is processed by machines using tools such as computers, software, printers/scanners, etc

## Automatic VS Manual
Automatic will be faster but less accurate, and manual will be slower but more accurate.
Automatic data processing also has to be trained based off manual data processing, meaning it costs a lot more to setup.
