# How do businesses use social media?
## TikTok
Because [TikTok](https://tiktok.com) has a unique format of short-style videos, it can be easier to get users to view your product, since TikTok works mostly via the type of sounds and effects you use.

If you use a sound that's currently trending, you will notice a lot more potential customers coming towards your advertisements, due to most of TikTok's users being teenagers.

Tiktok is the #1 social media app, and the most downloaded app of 2021.

TikTok has over 1 billion users, which means a lot of potential customers.

TikTok shared that millennials on their platform are more likely to [share UGC](https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-GB/insights/tt1167) and tag a brand, while Gen Z TikTok users are 1.2x more likely than other platform users to DM a brand after buying a product.
