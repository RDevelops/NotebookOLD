# Computational Thinking skills
- Decomposition
- Pattern recognition
- Pattern generalisation and abstraction
- Representation of the problem

# Decomposition
Decomposition is breaking down tasks into smaller tasks;

### Why do we do it?
- Easier to focus on one task at a time
- Examine specific details clearly
- Smaller tasks are easier to understand and solve
- Makes problem solving more manageable.

# Pattern recognition
A pattern is a set of characteristics to describe something, and finding things that are similar.
### How it works



# Abstraction
Ignoring characteristics that we dont need to concentrate on what we do need.
e.g. when baking a cake we can ignore that we need ingredientes, but we can focus on the ingredientes we need.

# Representation of a problem or system
### Defenition
identifying what is needed to solve a problem or build a system and how th pieces fit together.

### Algorithms
Example algorithm for how to make a cuppa
