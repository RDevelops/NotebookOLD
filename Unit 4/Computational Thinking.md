# Computational Thinking skills
- Decomposition
- Pattern recognition
- Pattern generalization and abstraction
- Representation of the problem

# Decomposition
Decomposition is breaking down tasks into smaller tasks;

![[Decomposition.png]]

## Why do we do it?
- Easier to focus on one task at a time
- Examine specific details clearly
- Smaller tasks are easier to understand and solve
- Makes problem solving more manageable

## What is involved?
- Identifying and describing problems and processes
- Breaking down problems and processes into distinct steps
- Describing problems and processes as a set of structured steps
- Communicating key features of problems and process to others as relevant

## Example

| **Make Breakfast**  |
| -- | -- |
| - **Make Toast**     | - **Make Tea**      |
|   - Get bread and toaster   |   - Boil water   |
|   - Insert bread slices into the toaster   |   - Place tea bag in a cup   |
|   - Set toaster settings   |   - Pour hot water into the cup   |
|   - Wait for toast to pop up   |   - Add sugar or milk (if desired)   |


# Pattern recognition
A pattern is a set of characteristics to describe something, and finding things that are similar.
## Why do we do it?
- Enables automation of tasks based on patterns
- Detect irregularities
- Helps us quickly make sense of large amounts of data
- Uncover new possibilities and fixes to problems

## What is involved?
- Identifying common elements
- Identifying and interpreting the differences
- Describing patterns that have been identified
- Making predictions based on identified patterns
## Example
- A cake will need a precise quantity of specific ingredients
- Ingredients will be added at a specific time
- Each cake will bake for a specific period of time

| #| Cake 1 | Cake 2 |
| -| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Preheat oven to 180C | Preheat oven to 190C |
| 2 | Blend ingredients | Whisk butter and sugar |
| 3 | Bake for 25 minutes | Mix in eggs |
| 4 | Whisk 300ml of cream | Bake for 30 minutes |

# Abstraction
Abstraction is the simplification of a more complex process or feature

## Why do we do it?
- Provides "thinking distance" for the programmer
- Less worry about how something actually works
- helps to identify the repeating patterns that actually exist
- Decide what to include and what to ignore
## What is involved?
- Identifying key details
- Creating general concepts
- Adaptable levels of detail
- Simplifying complexity
## Example
| Example                | Abstraction                                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Real-World Scenario**| Building a car engine.                                    |
| **Abstraction Level 1**| Focusing on the engine as a whole without details.       |
| **Abstraction Level 2**| Identifying key components like pistons, valves, and fuel system. |
| **Abstraction Level 3**| Ignoring individual piston design and valve mechanism, focusing on functionality. |
| **Abstraction Level 4**| Further simplification, treating the engine as a black box that converts fuel into motion. |
# Algorithms
An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions for solving a specific problem or performing a particular task.

## Why do we use them?
- Provides a systematic approach to problem-solving
- Enables efficient and consistent solutions
- Can be reused for similar problems
- Facilitates analysis and optimization of processes

## What is involved?
- Defining the problem to be solved
- Designing a sequence of steps or instructions
- Ensuring correctness and completeness
- Analyzing time and space complexity
- Implementing and testing the algorithm
## Example

| # | instruction |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Turn on the electricity |
| 2 | Put the water in the kettle |
| 3 | Turn on the kettle |
| 4 | While the kettle boils, put tea bag and sugar in |
| 5 | Put hot water in |
| 6 | Mix |
| 7 | Beat your teabag and take it out |
| 8 | Add milk |
| 9 | Pour the tea down the sink |
