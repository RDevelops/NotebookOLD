# Terminology
| Term | Defenition | Example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Low level language | Machine code | Assembly |
| High level language | A language that is translated to machine code | Python |

# Low level languages
Low-Level languages are Machine code, commonly written in binary or assembly.
This type of language is easily readable by the machine.
Different types of languages are designed for different CPU architectures, so it is not portable and very complex to use

# High level languages
These programming languages hide the complexity by translating to low level languages.
Each instruction in a language can have 1000s of instructions in low-level languages
This translation can slow down execution speed.

# Programing paradigms
Approach to solve a problem
- OOP (object Oriented Programming)
	- Python
	- C++
- Imperative
- Procedural
	- C
- Functional
- Declarative

## Procedural
- First languages learnt by a programmer usualy
- cinsidered to be general purpose tools
- well defined steps wto solve a specofoc problem
- if the steps become over complicated you an make them into functions/different procudes
C is an example

## OOP
- data structures or objects are defined with properties or attributes
- e.g. class Animals will have dogs, cats, etc as objects
Java, C++, C#

## Event Driven
- The program is decided by inputs or messages from other programs, e.g. events
- Can be written in almost any language
## Mark Up
- HTML, XML
- Formatting of a document
- Represent complex data structures
- Can move info from RDMS to XML to move to other formats
